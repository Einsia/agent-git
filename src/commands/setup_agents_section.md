## Session version control (agit)

Use agit to manage this project's agent sessions:

- Start with `agit status --json`. An adopted session still needs an explicit `<owner/repo>@<branch>` or `AGIT_SESSION`; directory bindings and native runtime IDs do not select it.
- Settle completed phases with `agit commit <owner/repo>@<branch> --milestone "<summary>"` (add `--code` when relevant). Importing a session does not set `AGIT_SESSION` in the calling process.
- If resumed as a merge agent, follow the `AGIT_MERGE_TX` protocol in the agit skill.
- Never rebase or force-push AgentGit history; remove context with `agit revert <owner/repo>@<branch>#n.k`. `@` requires `AGIT_SESSION`.
